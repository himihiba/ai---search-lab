# Handwritten Digit Recognition with MindSpore & PyQt5

This project is a simple **MNIST digit classifier** built with [MindSpore](https://www.mindspore.cn/en) and integrated with a **PyQt5 drawing interface** so you can draw digits and get real-time predictions.

It was **from a lab exercise** from the Huawei ICT Academy **AI & Search** course.

##  Features
- **MNIST dataset loading** with preprocessing (resizing, rescaling, reshaping)
- **Fully connected neural network** with ReLU and Softmax activation
- **Training & evaluation** with MindSpore
- **Custom PyQt5 drawing interface** for real-time digit prediction
- Saves drawn images and runs prediction directly on them


##  Requirements
- linux only so i used virtuall box
- Python 3.8+
- [MindSpore](https://www.mindspore.cn/en)
- PyQt5
- matplotlib
- numpy
- Pillow


## Note 
change paths for the datasets as requeir
